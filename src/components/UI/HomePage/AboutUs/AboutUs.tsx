              Our mission is to save lives and improve health through the
              power of blood donation. We believe that every drop of blood
              counts and that a small act of kindness can make a significant
              difference in someoneâ€™s life. Our goal is to create a safe and
              reliable blood supply that supports hospitals and medical centers
              in their efforts to treat patients in need.
